::Lazy way to run drone hardware console
::Edit path to appropriate values for your system

::Can be called by Java to load JS in the background and start the
::drone hardware console first (which is a must for it to work) -- 
::final path can be fixed relative to the location where we package
::the files as we near project completion


::Run Once, Leave Command Console Open
	cd c:\users\michael\desktop\drone\drone\node_modules\drone
	cmd.exe /K "node drone"

::Use this for final application
::Run Once, Close When JS Closes
	::cd c:\users\michael\desktop\drone\drone\node_modules\drone
	::node drone

::Run Once, Pause Before Closing Completely
	::cd c:\users\michael\desktop\drone\drone\node_modules\drone
	::node drone
	::pause
